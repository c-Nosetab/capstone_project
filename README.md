Welcome to my capstone Project. As of now, I have just completed the MVP version of my application. If you wanted to, you could absolutely use this as a portal for employees to get their schedules. However, I plan on taking this quite a bit further. In the near future I will be working to incorporate Vue into this app, while also creating an API within the app, to allow better usability. If I am given enough time, I'll also be learning Swift and developing an iOS app to go along with this project as well.

I made some changes
